## Transactions
Transactions are any entry in the ledger that record the movement of money.
Tyche enforces the double entry bookkeeping system; making it mandatory to enter both the group the
money was taken from AND where it was put.


Every transaction contains: the date of the transaction, the group the money was taken from, the group the money was given to,
details about it, it's monetary value, and the currency.
